# Books to Scrape - Data Scrapping Project

## Overview

This project involves web scraping and data analysis of book listings from the "Books to Scrape" website. The goal is to extract relevant information about books, clean and analyze the data, and present insights in a Jupyter notebook.

## Project Structure

- **Books_to_Scrape.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the code for scraping, data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Key Features

- **Web Scraping**: Extracts book titles, prices, ratings, availability, and more from the website using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, data type conversions, and other preprocessing tasks to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations to uncover trends and patterns in the book listings.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mostafa-Salama-1/Books_to_Scrape-Scrapping-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd Books_to_Scrape-Scrapping-
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Books_to_Scrape.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells to perform web scraping, data analysis, and visualization.

## Results

- The notebook provides detailed insights into the book data, including price distribution, rating analysis, and availability status.
- Visualizations are included to enhance understanding of the data.
